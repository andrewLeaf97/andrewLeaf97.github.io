                <h2 class="mb-5">My Hobbies and Free Time</h2>
                <p>
                Beyond software development, I have cultivated a strong passion for basketball coaching, 
                which has been a fundamental part of my personal and professional growth. 
                Over the years, I have guided athletes across different age groups and competitive levels, 
                developing leadership, communication, and team-building skills.
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li><b>2015 – 2016</b>: Assistant Coach at <b>US Livorno Basket</b> (U16 and U18 teams).</li>
                <li><b>2016 – 2025</b>: Instructor and Youth Coach at <b>Pallacanestro Don Bosco Livorno</b>, working in the minibasket sector and with youth teams.</li>
                <li><b>2022 – 2024</b>: Head Coach at <b>Basket Femminile Livorno</b> (U13 and U14 teams).</li>
                <li><b>2023 – 2024</b>: Coach at the <b>Regional Technical Training Center (CTF) – Tuscany</b>.</li>
                <li><b>2025 – Present</b>: Coach and Minibasket Instructor at <b>IES Basket Pisa</b>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                I hold the certifications of <b>Regional Coach</b> (2016) and <b>National Minibasket Instructor</b> (2023), 
                which validate my continuous commitment to the sport and to youth development. 
                These experiences outside of IT have enhanced my ability to lead teams, mentor individuals, and work under pressure — skills that I also bring into my professional career as a Full Stack Developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                In addition to basketball, I enjoy traveling, exploring new technologies, and gaming — especially the Pokémon series.  
                I am also an <b>amateur photographer</b>, passionate about capturing moments and stories through images.
